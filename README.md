# BudgetTracker
Hey fellas!
Since late last year, I've been working on this project as somehting I could do to practice my Python & data analysis skills while it benefits myself.
However, I have realized in recent days that this project needs (to say the least) some real make-over. It needs to be renovated.

So from now on, I've decided to almost re-write the entire application with the following end goals:

<ol>
<li>	Make it more <b>READ</b>able by making most of the application <b>object-oriented</b>	</li>
<li>	Write more extensive <b>documentations</b> on algorithms & functions.	</li>
<li>	Re-organize the <b><i>database</i></b> for much needed clarity in data.	</li>
</ol>

I will write more about the 'renovation' in a bit.
